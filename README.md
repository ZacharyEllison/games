# ZELLIS FOSS Games learning

As a repository of learning game design through projects.

Relying on the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/) and [Godot Roadmap](https://www.godotroadmap.com/roadmap) 
for both inspiration and guidance.

The hope is to make them all playable on web and through this repo.
